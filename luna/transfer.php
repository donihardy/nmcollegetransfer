                        <p>The Concurrent Enrollment/Dual-Credit program provides an extraordinary opportunity for students to
                          take academic or vocational college courses while in high school. Concurrent enrollment refers to
                          enrollment of high school students in courses at the post-secondary level that are not designated as
                          dual-credit and may include remedial or developmental courses. Dual-credit refers to enrollment of
                          high school students in college-level courses offered by a post-secondary institution that may be
                          academic or career technical, and simultaneously allows high school students to earn credit towards
                          high school graduation and a post-secondary degree or certificate. </p>
