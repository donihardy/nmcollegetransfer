                <div><h4 id="tes">Transferable Courses</h4>
                  <p>To facilitate the transfer of courses within certain degree programs, New Mexico colleges and universities have collaborated to develop transferable discipline modules. These are composed of an agreed upon number of hours and courses. When discipline module courses are taken in addition to the 35-hour general education core, the total number of hours in a transfer module is approximately 64. For information on the transferable discipline module for Business, see the Las Cruces catalog College of Business chapter. For information on the transferable discipline module for Early Childhood Education, see the College of Education chapter. Information on all available statewide transfer modules can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department web site at www.hed.state.nm.us.</p>

                      <h4 id="dual">High School Dual Enrollment</h4>
                      <p>Dual Credit is a statewide sponsored program for eligible High School Students in which they can receive high school credit for taking approved college courses.
                        <p>If you qualify, you can take courses at NMSU-A which will grant you both high school and college credit. The University waives tuition and general fees, while the high school provides most textbooks. Dual credit is a wonderful opportunity to explore the secondary education system and gain credits that will help you succeed in the future as well as exploring possible career options for when you graduate. NMSU-A admissions policy requires juniors and seniors to have a 2.0 GPA in order to take vocational, technical, or applied courses and a 3.0 GPA to take academic courses. Sophomores must have a 3.75 GPA. Some courses require taking a placement test before enrolling to ensure all students the greatest chance for success. Some courses, including PE and developmental courses, do not qualify as part of Dual Credit.
                          <p>If you wish to participate in Dual Credit, first you will need to consult your high school counselor. Then, you will interview with the Dual Credit Advisor. Also, you must provide the following documentation:</p>
                            <ul><li>completed, signed, and dated Agreement of Understanding</li>
                              <li>completed, signed, and dated Dual Credit Request Form</li>
                              <li> high school transcript</li></ul>
                              <p>In all cases, the college Dual Credit Advisor has the final decision on course selection. As a Dual Credit student, you are admitted to NMSU-A in a nondegree-seeking status. After high school graduation, you must apply for admission and change your status to degree-seeking in order to continue.</p>
