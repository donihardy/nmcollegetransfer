            <h4 id="childcare">Child Care</h4>
            <p>Many students, at one time or another, will need assistance beyond what we can provide in the Office of Student Services. All of us face a variety of personal, social, or financial problems as we move through life. There may be times when these problems seem to be too difficult to deal with on our own. To assist our students in finding the help they need, we have made a list of providers or agencies who have been helpful to students in the past.</p>

            <h4 id="parent">Parent Info</h4>
            <p>As your student may have a desire to participate in Dual Credit it is important to know the rights that you as parents have and the rights that the students have under the FERPA policy.</p>
