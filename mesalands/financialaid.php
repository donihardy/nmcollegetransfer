          <P>The decision to go to college is life-changing. Having financial aid to pay for a college education makes the decision a little easier. Most students at Mesalands Community College are able to graduate with their associate degree ready to start work or transfer to a four year college or university without debt. This allows students to concentrate on the future rather than be burdened by student loans.</P>
