            <h4 id="active">Active Duty</h4>
            <p>ENMU-Ruidoso defines military personnel as active duty or veterans and has three admission programs designed for military personnel. They are the Active Duty Military program (ADM), Servicemen’s Opportunity College (SOC), and the Military Admissions Programs (MAP).</p>
            <p><strong>Credit for Military Service</strong></p>
            <p>Military credit is accepted as elective credit, and it is the decision of the individual college how the credit may be applied to degree requirements. If the American Council on Education Guide (ACE) does not have an evaluation of a course completed, and if the course is comparable to a course offered by ENMU-Ruidoso, an individual may take a course challenging examination. For these guidelines, see “Course Challenging” of the catalog.</p>
            <p>Active duty military and veterans may secure a waiver of the 1 hour well-being general education requirement (HPE 142) and 3 hours of physical activity general education requirement.
              <p><strong>Appeal Transfer Evaluation:</strong></p>
              <p>If courses are not accepted for transfer to ENMU-Ruidoso, the student may appeal. A student who wishes to appeal the transfer evaluation should follow the steps outlined below:</p>
              <ol type="1"><li>File a written appeal (letter with Student Services, providing information regarding the course(s) being appealed). This information includes the following: a. A course description b. Syllabus from the course at the time it was taken, and/or c. Other documentation about the content of the course being appealed. </li>
                <li>Within 30 days of the written appeal, the file will be reviewed and the student will be contacted in writing. If the appeal is denied, the letter will explain the reason for the denial. </li>
                <li>If the student is denied and wants to continue the appeal, the student must indicate this in writing to the Vice President of Academic Learning. The second appeal must be submitted within 30 days of the first appeal decision letter. </li>
                <li>The second appeal letter will be reviewed within the next 30 days after receipt, and the student will be notified in writing as to the decision. </li>
                <li>If the student is denied a second time, and wishes to continue the appeal, the student may appeal directly to the New Mexico Education Department</li></ol>
