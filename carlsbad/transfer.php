              <h3>Course Transfer Info</h3>
              <p>The Office of Student Services assists current and prospective students in completing the admissions process, maintaining current student files and monitoring academic standing. Additionally, student enrollment status is continually updated and unofficial transcripts and academic records are maintained for all past or present students.</p>
              
              <h4 id="transcripts">Transcripts</h4>

              <p>Request official transcripts of high school or GED and all previous college course work. All official transcripts
                should be mailed directly by the school or college registrar to:</p>
                <p>NMSU Carlsbad<br />
                  ATTN: Admissions Office<br />
                  1500 University Drive<br />
                  Carlsbad, NM 88220</p>
                  <p>Official NMSU transcripts can be ordered online at <a href="http://nmsu.edu/~registra/transcripts">http://nmsu.edu/~registra/transcripts</a> or by mail (see <a href="https://carlsbad.nmsu.edu/students/all-students/student-services/">Student Services</a>). An electronic transcript is $10.00 and a paper transcript is $12.25. For questions, contact the NMSU Las Cruces Registrar’s office at (575)646-4990. Official name changes on transcripts will be processed only if a student is currently enrolled and a written request is submitted.</p>
                  <div><h4 id="tes">Transferable Courses</h4>
                    <p>On the basis of transcript evaluation, credit may be granted for courses taken at other colleges or universities in which a grade of D or higher is earned. Semester and cumulative grade-point averages are computed solely on courses taken at New Mexico State University; however, transfer credits that are accepted will apply toward the degree. Transcripts from other universities must be provided to NMSU Carlsbad as part of the admission process and are evaluated by the Registrar Office at the Las Cruces campus. Transcripts will only be evaluated after the student is officially enrolled as a regular status student. The Chief Academic Officer/Provost may evaluate credits from non-accredited institutions after the student has completed two semesters in fulltime status with satisfactory grades and make recommendation to the Registrar Office for acceptance.</p>
                    <h4 id="commoncore">Common Core Courses</h4>
                    <p>The New Mexico General Education Common Core consists of designated general education courses guaranteed to transfer to any New Mexico public college or university. A complete list of approved courses can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department (HED) web site www.hed.state.nm.us. The currently approved NMSU courses impacting NMSU Carlsbad’s English, Humanities and Fine Arts Division are listed below under the HED’s designations Area I and Area V.
