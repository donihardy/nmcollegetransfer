                <h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>
                <p>Transfer students from other colleges or universities will be accepted for undergraduate studies if they have at least a C (2.0) cumulative grade average and are eligible to return to the college or university last attended. The transfer student must submit official transcripts or records of credit earned at each college or educational institution previously attended within the first two weeks. These transcripts must be sent directly to the NMSU Carlsbad Admissions Office by the registrar of each institution attended. A student who conceals the fact that he/she has attended another college or university and who does not submit a transcript for each institution, whether or not credit was earned, can be subject to immediate suspension. Transcripts are evaluated, allowable credits are determined, and class standing is assigned only after the formal application for admission is submitted.</p>
