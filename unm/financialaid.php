            <h4 id="pellgrant">Pell Grant</h4>
            <p>What is the Pell Grant? -The Federal Pell Grant is the largest of the federal need-based grant programs. It is awarded automatically to students who qualify based on your FAFSA application results.</p>
            <br /><p>Who is Eligible for the Pell Grant? - To receive this grant, you must be an undergraduate student who has not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. (A professional degree is usually earned in a field such as medicine, law, or dentistry after earning a bachelor's degree.)</p>
            <br /><p>How is the amount of Pell Grant determined? - The Pell Grant amount you receive depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and your enrollment (the number of credits you take.)
            Amounts can change yearly. The maximum Federal Pell Grant for the 2015-16 award year (July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015) is $5,775. The amount you get, though, will depend on: your financial need, (EFC), your cost of attendance, your status as a full-time or part-time student, and your plans to attend school for a full academic year or less.</p>

            <h4 id="scholarship">Scholarships</h4>
            <p>The Office of Admissions along with the Office of Financial Aid administer the majority of Scholarships at the University of New Mexico. Scholarship awards and selection processes are subject to change. Scholarships are traditionally known as merit-based, and a competitive process usually accompanies the activities surrounding selection and monitoring of the various programs. Major responsibilities and duties within the scholarship structure deal with the formation of student programs and the administration of these programs.</p>

            <h4 id="loan">Loans</h4>
            <p>Loans are the last type of aid for which you are considered, after gift aid and work-study. Loans are considered self-help financial aid because you must repay the money loaned to you. You have the right to cancel, reduce, or accept in part any of the loans that have been offered or accepted in your Financial Aid package. UNM encourages responsible borrowing, so you should determine the amount you need and only borrow that amount. Your loans can be reduced or canceled even after the funds have been disbursed to your Student Account.</p>

            <h4 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h4>
            <p>Priority Deadline every year is March 1</p>
            <p>Meeting the March 1 priority deadline means that you will be considered for certain Grants and Work-study funds that are limited.</p>
            <p>If you do not meet the March 1 priority deadline you should still submit your FAFSA as soon as possible to be considered for the Federal Pell Grant and Student Loans.</p>
