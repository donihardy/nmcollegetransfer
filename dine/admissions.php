A half-time student carries 6 to 8 credits per semester and must compete 12 credits in an academic year.</p>
            <p>Students who have earned less than 32 credit hours are classified as freshmen. Students with more than 32 credit hours and no more than 72 credit hours are classified as sophomores.</p>
            <p>Area High School junior and seniors may be admitted upon submission of a completed and signed High School Concurrent Enrollment Form, which includes parent, high school counselor and principal signatures as well as a high school transcript to enroll in approved courses.
