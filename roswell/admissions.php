           <p><a href="http://www.roswell.enmu.edu/admissions-checklist">Admissions</a><br />
            <h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>
            <p>Students transferring to ENMU Roswell must file official transcripts from each college or university attended. Students with fewer than 30 semester hours of acceptable transfer credit must also have official high school transcripts sent. If students on suspension from another institution wish to enroll in courses at ENMU Roswell, they may appeal to the Academic Standards Committee for an admission waiver. They should be WARNED, however, that credits earned during suspension periods may not be accepted by receiving institutions.</p>
            <p>It is now easier than ever to transfer to a four-year university. Whether it is because you have received your associate’s degree, or are just simply at a point in your life where you are ready to move on to and experience something different.</p>
            <p>Even if your plan is to transfer at a later time, please browse through our transfer information below.</p>
            <p>In-state transfers, please pay special attention to the New Mexico General Education Common Core. This list of courses is guaranteed to transfer to any other university within the state of New Mexico!</p>
            <p>Aviation students, if you are transferring with credits from another school, please send the Office of Admission and Records an official transcript. Feel free to email the Advising and Retention Center a scanned or electronic copy (e-copy) of your unofficial student copy of your transcript with any course pre-requisite, course equivalency, or override questions you may have.</p>
