            <p>Academic advisors assist students as they become self-directed learners by teaching them to develop educational plans directed toward their academic, career, and personal aspirations.</p>
            <p>While the ultimate responsibility for planning and completing an academic program in compliance with university, college, and departmental requirements rests with the student, advisors are here to help you.
            </p>
            <p>NMSU has six colleges and offers over 80 undergraduate degree programs. Each college and department handles advising students a little differently. Undeclared and Undecided students are advised through the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
