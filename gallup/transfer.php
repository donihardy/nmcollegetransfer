            <h4 id="transcripts">Transcripts</h4>
            <p>To receive transfer credit from previous institutions, official transcripts from those institutions must be mailed directly to UNM Gallup Office of Admissions. A transfer evaluation, reflecting those transfer credits acceptable at UNM, will be generated only after the student is officially admitted to a degree program at UNM Gallup or UNM Albuquerque.</p>

              <div><h4 id="tes">Transferable Courses</h4>
                <p>Students intending to go to the Albuquerque campus to pursue a four-year degree should be aware that many of the necessary prerequisites for Albuquerque campus degree programs are offered at UNM Gallup. Students are cautioned that courses listed with an * (e.g., BSTC 232*) are considered to be technical/vocational courses and are not acceptable for transfer to baccalaureate programs except by petition to, and acceptance from, a UNM degree-granting program.</p>
                <p>Students are encouraged to work with UNM Gallup advisors in planning their programs. Students wishing to transfer to the Albuquerque campus, and who are enrolled in programs offered only at UNM Gallup, must file an application and meet the admissions requirements of the specific college to which they are applying.

                        <p>To be considered for concurrent enrollment it is necessary for the student to meet the following minimum requirements. Meeting the criteria listed does not mean the student will be automatically admitted. The final determination of admission rests with the admissions officer.</p>
                        <ol type="1"><li>The student must be a high school senior or junior with an expected graduation date within two calendar years (twenty-four months).</li>
                          <li>The student must have the certification and unconditional recommendation of the high school principal or guidance counselor.</li>
                          <li>Minimum qualitative requirements:
                            <ol type="1"><li>In the top 25 percent of high school class in grade point average, or</li>
                              <li>Cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale for ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade in subjects counted toward graduation, or</li>
                              <li>ACT composite score of 23, or an SAT total score of 1100.</li></ol></li></ol>

                              A concurrent enrollment student at UNM is subject to the same academic regulations as other UNM students in non-degree status, including those governing attendance, minimum grade point average, change of program, and withdrawal.
