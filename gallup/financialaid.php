            <h4 id="pellgrant">Pell Grant</h4>
            <p>A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Federal Pell Grants usually are awarded only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelorâ€™s or a professional degree.</p>

            <h4 id="scholarship">Scholarships</h4>
            <p>Scholarships are funded from many different sources. Each may require different application(s) and renewable criteria. Students are responsible for knowing the deadlines, application procedures, and renewable criteria for each scholarship(s) they receive. Students cannot receive more than one scholarship that is designated strictly for tuition expenses.</p>
            <p>Remember to apply early - preferably before May of the fall term you plan to attend or before October of the spring term you plan to attend.</p>
            <p>To ensure student confidentiality, photo identification is required for all students requesting assistance from the Financial Aid Office.</p>

            <h4 id="loan">Loans</h4>
            <p>All loans are subject to individual student eligibility and fund availability. Borrowing should be done conservatively to avoid heavy loan debt and the potential for default.</p>
            <p>UNM-Gallup is part of the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans Program effective as of July 1, 2010. UNM-Gallup offers Federal Stafford Loans, which are fixed-rate federal student loans for undergraduates and graduate students attending college at least half-time. Students must be admitted as "degree-seeking" and must be enrolled at least half-time to qualify for federal student loans.</p>
