                  <p>At the outset of each term, Student Services offers orientation programs to answer student questions and ease the transition into college life. The programs are usually three hours in length and cover such topics as: tips for success, grades, degree choices, transferring, dropping and adding classes, getting in touch with instructors, obtaining child care, obtaining financial aid, available services, facilities, and more.</p>
                  <p>New students are required to participate in Orientation, since it has been shown that the academic success rate is higher for students who have been through orientation. At this time the Schedule of Classes and the catalog are explained, and several helpful handouts are provided.</p>
