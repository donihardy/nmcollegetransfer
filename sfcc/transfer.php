                <p>SFCC offers many of these courses; however, planning for effective transfer with maximum efficiency is ultimately your responsibility. You are highly encouraged to consult with advisers at the institution you plan to transfer, in order to clearly determine how the courses will be applied toward graduation.</p>

In some cases, you may still be required to write an essay.</p>
