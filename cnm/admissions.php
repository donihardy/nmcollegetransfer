            <h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>
            <p>To help you transfer your course credits between New Mexico’s colleges and universities, the state’s public institutions of higher education are required to accept in-state transfer courses taken within approved modules of lower-division course work and apply them toward degree requirements.</p>
            <p>New Mexico’s colleges and universities have developed transfer guides, consistent with requirements of state law (21-1B, NMSA 1978), to help you transfer.
            </p>
            <p>Students applying for admission to CNM with at least 24 transferrable credits must have at least a “C” average (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) in all transferrable college work attempted. Individual colleges or programs may have additional requirements. Please refer to the CNM Catalog for specific program requirements.</p>
