            <p>Other grants:<br />
              SEOG Grant<br />
              College Affordability Grant<br />

              <h4 id="scholarship">Scholarships</h4>
              <p>The Doña Ana Community College Office of Financial Aid & Scholarship Services offers a wide array of scholarships to assist a diverse student population pursuing a higher education. As an open-door institution, our office is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to students regardless of personal, economic, or social conditions.</p>
              <p>As most of the scholarships require you to demonstrate financial need you are encouraged to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at fafsa.ed.gov.</p>
              <p>Students affiliated with a Native American tribe should contact their individual Tribal Scholarship Agency regarding the required paperwork for tribal scholarships.</p>
              <p><i>Many of our scholarships require students to:</i><br />
                <ul><li>Be NM residents</li>
                  <li>Have graduated from a NM high school or received a NM GED</li>
                  <li>Be admitted to DACC in a degree-seeking program</li>
                  <li>Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress as many scholarships have varying GPA requirements</li>
                  <li>Eligibility and renewal criteria vary.</li>
                  <li>Consideration or nomination for a scholarship require a Scholar Dollar$ application to be submitted each year.</li></ul></p>

                  <h4 id="loan">Loans</h4>
                  <p>Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans are need and non-need based, long-term loans available to undergraduate students.  Students receiving a Subsidized or Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan must complete an In-Person Entrance Counseling session and sign a valid Master Promissory Note prior to the semester for which they intend to receive the loan, before DACC will issue the funds.</p>
                  <p>Student loans, unlike grants and work-study, are borrowed money that must be repaid, with interest, just like car loans and home mortgages. You cannot have these loans canceled because you didn’t like the education you received, didn’t get a job in your field of study or because you’re having financial difficulty. Loans are legal obligations, so before you take out a student loan, think about the amount you’ll have to repay over the years and review your borrower rights and responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>Types of loans:<br />
                    Federal Perkins Loan<br />
                    Subsidized Stafford Loan<br />
                    Unsubsidized Stafford Loan<br />
                    Federal Plus Loan<br />
                    Private/Alternative Loans</p>
