              </p>
              <h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>
              <p>Prospective transfer students may be eligible for undergraduate studies with a cumulative GPA of at least a 2.00 and be eligible to return to the college or university last attended.  Students must submit official transcripts from all colleges and/or universities previously attended.  A student who conceals the fact that (s)he has attended another college or university and who has not had official transcripts submitted by each institution previously attended-whether or not credit was earned-will be subject to immediate suspension.  An academic credit evaluation will be mailed to you from the Doña Ana Community College Academic Advising Office, 575.528.7272.</p>

              <h4 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h4>
              <p>The community college endorses the open-door admission
                concept and will admit—to the limit of its physical and financial resources—new,
                first-time students who wish to attend and who have a high school
                diploma or its equivalent. High school diplomas must be from an accredited
                high school. Diplomas from accredited, on-line high schools, however, are
                subject to strict review and may not in all cases be judged valid for the purpose
                of enrolling at DACC.</p>
