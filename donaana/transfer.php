            <h4 id="transcripts">Transcripts</h4>

            <p>Request official High School transcripts or GED test scores and college transcripts (if applicable) from each educational institution attended.  All official transcripts must be mailed directly to DACC Office of Admissions by the records/registrar's office of the issuing institution(s).</p>

            <p>If your college/university is able to send official transcripts electronically, we will accept them through eSCRIP-SAFE as long as your school is a member SENDER.  DACC does not accept transcripts sent or carried in hand by applicants themselves or transmitted by fax.  High School transcripts must show GPA and Date of Graduation.</p>

                <p>Transfer Credits</p>
                <p>Credits from accredited postsecondary institutions are automatically evaluated
                  after official transcripts are received by the DACC Admissions Office.
                  A transfer student may, on the basis of an evaluation of her/his transcripts,
                  receive credit for courses taken at other postsecondary institutions in which
                  a grade of D or higher was received. However, D grades at DACC / NMSU
                  will not satisfy basic academic competency (basic skills) in English and
                  mathematics. Additionally, individual programs may choose to only accept
                  courses graded C or higher in their programs. Grades earned in
                  courses taken at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the
                  DACC / NMSU GPA.</p>
                  <p>Coursework from non-accredited institutions may be evaluated only after
                    the student has completed 12 credits at DACC with a minimum GPA of
                    2.0. DACC has an established process for evaluating coursework completed
                    at international institutions, non-accredited institutions/training academies,
                    and through high school articulation agreements. The student should initiate
                    the request for evaluation of this coursework with the academic department
                    chair or program director. If approved by the division dean and vice president
                    for academic affairs, coursework can be applied toward certificate or
                    associate degree completion.</p>
                    <p>Credit for Prior Learning or Military Experience</p>
                    <p>Academic credit may be granted through the COLL 185 course for substantial
                      previous training in the student’s major area of study. Experience gained
                      in the military can also be evaluated for course credit. Contact Academic
